**Huanjia Zhang** never thought he would become a journalist in a foreign country. He grew up in Yantai, a cozy city on China’s northeast coast. As a biology major at Gettysburg College, he studied salamanders. Wading through frigid ponds to hunt for salamander eggs, he unfolded a passion for science storytelling. After college, Huanjia worked at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia researching the human microbiome. Now, he is a graduate journalism student at NYU’s Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program. In his spare time, he reads and cooks, then repeats.
